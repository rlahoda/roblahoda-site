Welcome to my personal website! This site is a compilation of my personal projects and blog where I post occasionally about things I'm learning or doing.

## About this site

This site is built on [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to give me an edit interface for the site.

## About Me

I'm a front-end web developer based in central Ohio. I've been doing various front-end work since 2012, building a variety of projects for personal and client needs. My knowledge includes extensive understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript, especially React. I've been doing some work in React as well.

I've worked with a variety of proprietary and open source content management systems including Drupal and Wordpress. I've created custom themes in both. I've worked in a corporate role maintaining and enhancing the commercial website as well as building sites for clients of various sizes.
