I'm a front-end web developer based in central Ohio. I've been doing various front-end work since 2012, building a variety of [projects](/projects) for personal and client needs. My knowledge includes extensive understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript, especially React. I've been doing some work in React as well.

I've worked with a variety of proprietary and open source content management systems including Drupal and Wordpress. I've created custom themes in both. I've worked in a corporate role maintaining and enhancing the commercial website as well as building sites for clients of various sizes.

In addition to my front-end experience, I've worked as a professional photographer, videographer, video engineer, and motion graphics designer. Take a look at my multimedia portfolio at [media.roblahoda.com](http://media.roblahoda.com).
