My first project that I'm working on is an interactive flash card web app. The idea came from my own efforts in learning French and how lousy I am at memorizing words. Since I want this to be an opportunity for me and others to learn from the iterative process, I'm building the project on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/rlahoda/) to allow others to see the source and also so I can continually save new versions as I hit various road map points. As I go, I'll try to add helpful information and lessons that I've learned to the descriptions for my pens and also I plan to create a post that will be more specifically documenting the process that I'm going through and what I'm learning.

[Click Here to visit the Project Collection Page](http://codepen.io/collection/DyyMOQ/) and view the pens as I create them.

#### Goals:

- User can type in front/back contents and cards are updated live
- Card contents populated without reloading page
- Click on card to view back
- Animated transition between front and back of card
- Card layout responsive
- Ability to store the contents of the cards without a database, one idea is to use the URL to store the information similar to Google Translate

#### The page will use the following technologies:

    - Flexbox for responsive resizing of the cards
    - Javascript for the interactivity with the card
    - SASS (SCSS) for the stylesheet
    - HAML for the HTML processing
