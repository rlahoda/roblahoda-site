intro:

    - text: |
        I'm a front-end web developer based in central Ohio.
        I work on all kinds of sites, but I especially love working with Drupal.
    - text: >
        I've worked on projects large and small. I love building projects that
        tell stories and expose the user to information in an interesting and
        engaging way.
    - text: >
        Being a part of the Drupal community is important to me. I've been to
        [Drupalcamp PA](http://drupalcamppa.net/), I'm a member of the [Drupal
        Association](https://www.drupal.org/association), and I try to
        contribute and share the knowledge I have with others.
    - text: >
        When I'm not working on projects, I love cycling, traveling, spending
        time with my family, and expanding my knowledge of web development.
    - text: >
        I'm not just a developer, I'm also a photographer and videographer.
